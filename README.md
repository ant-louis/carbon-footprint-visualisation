# Data-visualisation

## Setup
In order to run the visualisations, your machine must have Python (3.6 or greater prefered) installed. You can find a tutorial on the installation and setup of Python [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).


In addition, the following packages should be installed:
- [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
- [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- [plotly](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/)
- [geopy](https://pypi.org/project/geopy/)
- [pyproj](https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/)
- [ipython](https://pypi.org/project/ipython/)
- [jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/)
- [ipywidgets](https://pypi.org/project/ipywidgets/)


Once Python installed, these libraries can be installed automatically by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Launch the visualisations

1. Open the notebook *my-visualisations.ipynb*.
